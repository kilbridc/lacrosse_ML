## Lacrosse ML Project

This project explores the key factors that contribute to the success of NCAA Division I Men’s Lacrosse teams. Using game data and tracked performance metrics, I applied multiple machine learning models to identify which aspects of gameplay are most strongly associated with winning outcomes.

Rather than trying to perfectly predict winners, the goal was to gain insight into the **statistics most closely tied to team success**, such as possession metrics, scoring efficiency, and riding/clearing effectiveness. These findings help highlight the strategic elements of the game that matter most.

As lacrosse continues to grow rapidly in popularity, **recent rule changes** — including the introduction of a shot clock, adjustments to faceoff rules, and the rise of the aggressive 10 Man Ride — have significantly influenced how the game is played. This project also considers how these changes impact strategy and statistical trends.
